CHANGELOG:

Added:
- Support for numbers in cells (If you had a question/answer being a pure number, it would crash the program)
- Errors are now printed at the end of a crash with a small hint to send the error message to the owner of the program.
Fixed:
- Changelog was not printing correctly (no newlines or tabs)
